# Hote API for Alten Test

This API was developer for the Changelled proposed by Alten.

CHALLENGE:
Post-Covid scenario:
People are now free to travel everywhere but because of the pandemic, a lot of hotels
went bankrupt. Some former famous travel places are left with only one hotel.
You’ve been given the responsibility to develop a booking API for the very last hotel in Cancun.
The requirements are:

- API will be maintained by the hotel’s IT department.
- As it’s the very last hotel, the quality of service must be 99.99 to 100% => no downtime
- For the purpose of the test, we assume the hotel has only one room available
- To give a chance to everyone to book the room, the stay can’t be longer than 3 days
and can’t be reserved more than 30 days in advance.
- All reservations start at least the next day of booking,
- To simplify the use case, a “DAY’ in the hotel room starts from 00:00 to 23:59:59.
- Every end-user can check the room availability, place a reservation, cancel it or modify it.
- To simplify the API is insecure.


This project is a RestAPI and was developed using .net 6.0, its using EF to save the reservation information on SQLite database.

After run, the solution can be tested using Swagger interface on https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html.
